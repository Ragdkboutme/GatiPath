**FlowSync** is an AI-driven traffic management system that uses **Computer Vision + Reinforcement Learning** to dynamically optimize traffic signal timings at urban intersections.  
Our goal: reduce congestion, improve commute efficiency, and lay the foundation for **smart, adaptive cities**.

## ✨ Features
- **Traffic Monitoring (OpenCV)** → Detects real-time vehicle density from CCTV/IP camera feeds.  
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent** → Learns optimal signal timings to minimize wait time & congestion.  
- **Simulation Environment** → A bird’s-eye **Pygame simulator** to test policies on 4-way intersections.  
- **IoT Sensors Integration (Concept)** → Detects potholes, waterlogging, and rainfall intensity.  
- **Scalable for Enhancements** → Emergency vehicle detection, GPS-based congestion maps, pollution-level alerts, and more.
